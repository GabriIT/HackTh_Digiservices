Cardano-based blockchain platform for service transactions with Smart Contracts

The growing need of goods and services exchange require a trustworthy social platform to act as escrow and eliminate non-delivery/non-payment crime, one of the largest and further growing one. Even though physical contracts appear to provide a solution, they are often misinterpreted because of their subjective language and they commonly lack the practicality needed in our digital word. We propose a platform that enables parties to create contracts stored in the Cardano blockchain and builds member trust based on token rewards and penalties, supported by a Credit Assessesment system of every platform member.
Parties that refuse to follow the rules pre-defined in the contract will be penalized by losing tokens proportionally to the severity of their misbehavior.
